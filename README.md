# Power-Consumption-Breakdown-Analysis
This repository is intended to host some exploratory data analysis done while I am experimenting with the modern Python data analysis stack. I will focus mainly on energy consumption breakdown at a country level and test some hypotheses regarding the energetic infrastructure of some countries.

All of this while trying to do some (hopefully) nice data vizualizations. 
I am open for any kind of feedback regarding my thought processes or my code.
